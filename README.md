## 🚀 Exercise 1 – Design Patterns (TypeScript)

As part of Exercise-1, six different design patterns were implemented in **TypeScript** to demonstrate their real-world applications.

### ✅ Implemented Patterns

1. **Observer Pattern** – Notifies dependent objects when the state changes.
2. **Strategy Pattern** – Dynamically selects and applies an algorithm at runtime.
3. **Singleton Pattern** – Ensures only a single instance of a class exists.
4. **Abstract Factory Pattern** – Creates related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
5. **Adapter Pattern** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
6. **Decorator Pattern** – Adds new functionality to objects without changing their structure.

### ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure **Node.js** is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the **Exercise-1** folder.
3. Install dependencies (if required):

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> 💡 This command will compile and execute all TypeScript files automatically.

## 🌍 Exercise 2 – Mini Project (Java)

### Project: **Satellite Command System**

The **Satellite Command System** is a **Java-based simulator** that models satellite operations in orbit. It provides a command-line interface for:

* Controlling satellite orientation
* Managing solar panels
* Collecting scientific data
* Demonstrating **object-oriented design principles**
* Implementing **command pattern** and error handling

### ▶️ How to Run (Java)

1. Navigate to the **Exercise-2** folder.
2. Compile the Java files:

```bash
javac FileName.java
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
java FileName
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Languages**: TypeScript, Java
* **Concepts**: OOP, Software Design Patterns, System Simulation
* **Tools**: Node.js, npm, TypeScript Compiler, IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

* Implemented six major **software design patterns** using **TypeScript**.
* Learned the role of design patterns in building reusable and maintainable code.
* Applied OOP concepts to simulate a **satellite control system** in Java.
* Improved modular design, problem-solving, and cross-language coding skills.
